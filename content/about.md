## About Me

I’m **Demian**, a senior software engineer, technical founder, and lifelong tinkerer who traded office walls for wide horizons. After nearly two decades building systems in Java, Groovy, and TypeScript, from monoliths that refused to die to microservices that wouldn’t sit still, I’ve learned that great engineering isn’t just about code. It’s about balance: performance and readability, ambition and restraint, coffee and… more coffee.

I work remotely from wherever the Wi-Fi is strong and the coffee doesn’t taste like regret. Most of my time goes into designing APIs, scaling systems, and using AI as a force multiplier rather than a crutch. My career has spanned everything from enterprise Java stacks to modern TypeScript and NestJS backends, and I’ve watched more than one “quick fix” become a mission-critical system with a personality disorder.

## What This Blog Is About

**Code and the Remote Life** is where I write about software, remote work, and the strange alchemy of keeping both running smoothly.  
You’ll find essays on architecture, development tools, and the craft of building reliable systems while working from anywhere.  
I also explore side projects, productivity in solitude, and the occasional philosophical detour on why developers keep rewriting everything in Go.

## Beyond the Keyboard

When I’m not writing code or dabbling with tech, I’m usually experimenting with photography, flying internet spaceships, geeking out about real spaceships, or watching anything related to Formula 1.  
If it involves creativity, technology, or engineering, I’m probably all in.

Welcome to **Code and the Remote Life**, part logbook, part lab notebook, and part therapy session for people who build things out of bits and caffeine.
