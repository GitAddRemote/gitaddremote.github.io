First let me explain the idea behind "Git Add Remote" and why I am playing off the git command "git remote add." This site, generally, will focus on two high-level topics. modern development practices and technologies, and the idea that a remote work-force is often a win-win for the employee and the company they work for.

The number one priority is to have a place where I can post articles about software development. Initially, much of the content will be focused on JavaScript and JVM based technologies, but in the future could also explore mobile development, devops, compiler concepts, etc. As a Java developer for nearly 20 years, I am transitioning to a more modern tech stack, and this site is where I am allowed to voice my successes and failures as I work towards mastering the entire stack.

The second, but a very close second, priority for this site is to explore the idea of a remote work-force. I will explore the benefits and challenges of having a remote workforce from both the employee and company perspective. I will deliberately seek out those that have been practicing remote work and try to learn their lessons and at the end of the day show who should be working remote, why it is beneficial in so many instances, and what it takes to make it work.

That is the intention anyway, but I am sure over time things will change, because change is a true constant...
