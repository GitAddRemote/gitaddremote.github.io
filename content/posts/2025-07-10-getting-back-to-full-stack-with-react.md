# I once, was a full stack developer. 

    - In years past I worked both backend and frontend with projects created with ASP, Java, JSP, and JSF.
    - While my skills were much stronger on the backend, I could sling HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed to get the job done.
    - Over the years as I started my own business and then more recently in other jobs, I have focused more on the backend.
    - With the advent of technologies like Angular and React, I lost a lot of my skills needed to make a modern day front end.

# Market Changes
    - While there have always been full stack jobs, there were still plenty of backend focsued jobs where companies expected you to go deep with that backend stack.
    - Based on my research in 2025, and my own job searches, companies are looking more and more for full stack engineers.
    - Looks like jack of all trades is valueable
