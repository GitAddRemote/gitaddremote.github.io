This can be completed via a take home project. Often however, the developer is asked to complete a practical code test during the interview. While I understand why this happens, I don’t believe setting up an adversarial situation during the interview process is ideal when hiring a new candidate. That said, it is a fact of life we as developers have to work through. As such it is a great idea to complete regular programmatic challenges as part of our interview preparation. Today, I decided to remake the Array.map function using promises for just a such a challenge.","fields":{"slug":"/recreating-map-function-with-promises/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 14, 2019","title":"Recreating Map Function With Promises","description":"","published":true,"categories":["javascript"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/20190916-001_create-production-ready-node-base-project/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 13, 2019","title":"Create Production Ready Node Base Project","description":"","published":false,"categories":["javascript","api"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/20190917-001_basic-style-component-with-gatsby-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 13, 2019","title":"Basic Styled Component With Gatsby Blog","description":"","published":false,"categories":["javascript","react"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/20190920-001_how-to-do-crud-with-github-issues-api/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 13, 2019","title":"How To Do CRUD with Github Issues API","description":"","published":false,"categories":["javascript","api"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/20190922-001_how-to-do-crud-with-slack-chat-api/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 13, 2019","title":"How To Do CRUD with Github Issues API","description":"","published":false,"categories":["javascript","api"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"The first thing I wanted to do after setting up this new blog using the Gatsby Starter Project is to make it possible to only display posts…","fields":{"slug":"/20190912-001_mark-a-file-as-unpublished-in-gatsby-starter-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 12, 2019","title":"Add Publish Flag To Posts In Gatsby","description":"The first thing I wanted to do after setting up this new blog using the Gatsby Starter Project is to make it possible to only display posts that I wanted to show.

This time however, I am starting a new adventure using tools that are largely new to me. While I have worked with raw JavaScript, and JavaScript based tools for about 20 years, Gatsby is a brand new world to me. It combines much of what I already know with new technologies I am actively working to master such as Node, React and GraphQL. Working with a complete focus of direction to living and breathing JavaScript based technologies coupled with a focus on proper work management via remote work and asynchronous communication, to say I am excited is an understatement.","fields":{"slug":"/git-add-remote/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 07, 2019","title":"Git Add Remote Initial Commit","description":"","published":true,"categories":["general"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
