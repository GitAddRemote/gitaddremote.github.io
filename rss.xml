WordPress is a fantastic tool, and truly is a wonderful tool for creating all manner of websites from blogs to e-commerce sites. That said, with the focus of this blog being more about my personal growth using JavaScript and mobile technologies it seems only fitting I use a tool based largely on that. But there is more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Something New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of blogging on WordPress, I admit I was keen to try something new. I wanted, not just a new technology stack, I wanted a new user experience. I wanted to think about blogging software from a new perspective. No yes, I am aware, Gutenberg blocks are really new in the WordPress space, but that still didn’t quite cut it. And yes, I know Gutenberg blocks are written using react, a technology used in Gatsby, but again. I just needed something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn By Doing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own style of learning. While I can of course gain knowledge through reading and 3rd party demonstrations, the best way for me to retain and build on new knowledge is to actually do things myself. By attempting to put something new into practice, I find the skills are etched deeper into my brain and I am able to repeat the process again, with less assistance or reference material. An additional benefit is I often learn the pain points of doing things the hard way. It is when I learn the pain points that I tend to start thinking of creative solutions to the problem. To this end, I am starting with nothing more than a basic Gatsby installation using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/&quot;&gt;Gatsby Starter Blog&lt;/a&gt; project. There is so much I want to learn that Gatsby is built upon or can utilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn By Teaching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I gain a better understanding of things, I find that I can even better understand and extend that knowledge by teaching it to others. Often those I am teaching think of questions that I either can’t answer in the moment causing me to do more research and add to my knowledge. Other times they will ask questions in a way I would never have considered. Again, causing me to do more research. And at the end of if it all, to be an effective teacher I have to break things down to an understandable level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough” —Albert Einstein (Or not, the internet can’t seem to decide who said this originally)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, I am wanting to advance my existing knowledge of JavaScript and React, and gain new knowledge in GraphQL. This is core to what Gatsby can do for me. Additionally, the flexibility of Gatsby means I could continue to use a markdown backed site (as I am doing to start this blog), or back it with something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, or even have the backend be a headless &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; installation. The point is, many of these things are the very topics I wish to teach via this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Only Constant Is Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in the IT industry for even a handful of years, this statement will ring very true. Change is the only constant, and to that end, being relevant in the software industry means staying current. Falling behind isn’t necessarily a job search killer, but as you fall further behind you will find it increasingly more difficult to find a gig. I know this from experience all too well. So, as I increase my skills, and teach these new skills, I will use the changes I make to this blog as a focus on some of the tutorials I will be posting. Every time I add a feature that I need for the blog I will do my best to document it in a tutorial that can hopefully help others.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Git Add Remote Initial Commit]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have written many blog posts on different blogs in the past.

This time however, I am starting a new adventure using tools that are largely new to me. While I have worked with raw JavaScript, and JavaScript based tools for about 20 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; is a brand new world to me. It combines much of what I already know with new technologies I am actively working to master such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphql.org/&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;. Working with a complete focus of direction to living and breathing JavaScript based technologies coupled with a focus on proper work management via remote work and asynchronous communication, to say I am excited is an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Git Add Remote Begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog I‌ will be writing about different areas of development through the lens of working as, or managing a, developer. The development tutorials and topics discussed in regards to software development will initially be focused on JavaScript technologies in the full stack realm. We will eventually be working through topics on mobile such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/swift/&quot;&gt;iOS development&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://swift.org/&quot;&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/kotlin&quot;&gt;Android development&lt;/a&gt; with Kotlin(&lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/&quot;&gt;https://kotlinlang.org/&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the topics surrounding remote work, mostly presence-free, asynchronous remote work, will explore tips and best practices the industry is using to make remote culture, work. Much of this discussion will be heavily influenced, at least initially, by the model of work exemplified by &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;. Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, both leading partners at Basecamp, have successfully bucked the trend of what makes a “great” software business as well as what makes a great business to work for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why “Git Add Remote”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with using Git, more specifically Git commands, you will notice “git add remote” should actually be “git remote add.” My reasoning for this is that I want to convey that in this world of software development, adding remote generally can make for a happier, more talented workforce, and thus a better product. Alas, I have to say that while I like this word switch, it initially was not deliberate. When I first typed the name for our twitter account, I mistyped the order. A happy accident then, as I liked the “incorrect” version even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What The Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a long history with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.java.com/en/&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, and moderately long history with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, part of my client business comes from creating Java applications as well as creating and hosting WordPress websites. The majority of my revenue and work comes from application development. In the past I have created these application using Java, JSF, Tomcat and Microsoft SQL Server. More recently however, I have had client work for Node.js and MongoDB API projects, with react clients. And that is largely what you will see here. While I will be feeling out my tutorial and writing style over time, I believe in creating projects to learn. This is why I plan on building small, easy to digest tutorials about Node.js, NoSQL databases, React and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I will be using this blog as a learning and teaching tool for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;. While I technically was a full stack developer in the past, I can’t as comnfortable make that claim when the client side is using tools like React, Angular, Vue, etc. Because of this, you will notice the blog to be a bit rough around the edges, but I hope over time that it gets more refined and robust. And of course I will document it every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About Demian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working professionally in the software world for just shy of 20 years. Starting out as a quality assurance analyst and then moving on to writing and leading small teams that write software, I have had my fair share of experiences in the corporate world. For the last few years I have run my own small agency hiring contractors for project work as needed. Throughout this time I have had various experiences with working from home and feel I have a strong grasp as to what a remote team, and a remote culture should look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not put myself in the role of an authority on the topic though and this is why, along with teaching and learning more about the modern development stack, I am creating this site. Also, at this point in my career, I am scaling back my client business to a part time effort and am interested in exploring contract work once again. This time however with a focus on high-functioning remote teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s Go!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. A standard opening blog post for a new blog. At this point other than the blog and my twitter account, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/gitaddremote&quot;&gt;@GitAddRemote&lt;/a&gt; I have no solid plans. There could be a future podcast, or maybe even a YouTube channel. But let’s take things one step at a time. While this idea of “Git Add Remote” is initially about me learning and voicing my thoughts and helping my learn by embracing the Feynman Technique, it is also about you.  If this site helps anyone at all then I have just gotten the icing on top of my cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One Last Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the point, while I will endeavour to ensure the tutorials are correct and clear, I will be operating under the philosophy of, Done is better than perfect. So let’s do this, good luck and happy learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.”?

How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
